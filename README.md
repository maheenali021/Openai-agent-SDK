🤖 What is Agentic AI?
1. Introduction 🚀
Agentic AI systems are autonomous digital workers that:

🎯 Independently complete tasks to achieve goals.
💡 Combine LLM intelligence + traditional programming reliability.
🌐 Solve complex problems across industries.

2. Key Components ⚙️
2.1 Large Language Models (LLMs) 🧠
Definition: AI trained on massive text data (powers ChatGPT, Claude)

Limitations in Agentic Systems:

⚠️ Hallucinations (solved with RAG)
⏸️ Needs Agentic AI to take action
🧠 Memory limits (~1M tokens)

2.2 LLM vs Agentic AI 🔄
Aspect	LLMs (ChatGPT)	     Agentic AI (AutoGPT)
Role	  Talk/Write	         Do Tasks
Prompt	Needs human input	   Self-starts
Output	Text/Code	           Real-world results

3. Evolution of AI 📜
AI Type         	Skills	          Limits
🏛️ Rule-Based    	Fixed rules	      Can't learn
📊 ML	            Finds patterns	  Needs retraining
🎨 Generative AI	Creates content	   Waits for prompts
🚀 Agentic AI	    Acts on its own	   Needs safety checks

4. Superpowers ✨
